Q1 ... https://codeforces.com/gym/285257/problem/A
Explanation:-
  here i have bassically calculated the max distance between 2 "R".
  So I have created a list having the indexes of all R in string s , including (0),(len(s)+1),
  then i have printed the max value of that list.
  
 Code:
 for _ in range(int(input())):
    s = list(input())
    d = [i+1 for i, val in enumerate(s) if val == "R"]
    d.append(0)
    d.append(len(s)+1)
    d.sort()
    size = [d[i] - d[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(d))]
    # print(size)
    if len(d) > 0:
        print(max(size))
    else:
        print(len(s) + 1)
